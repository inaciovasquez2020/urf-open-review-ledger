The Unified Capacity–Locality Problem

Problem Statement.
Consider any oracle-free, uniform, polynomial-time computation.

Question.
Is it true that every such computation admits a simulation by a process that:

1. Operates only on bounded-radius local state
2. Injects at most polylogarithmic information per step
3. Has total progress (entropy reduction or structural refinement)
   bounded by total injected information

Equivalently:
Is global computational progress universally limited by local information capacity?

Significance.
A positive answer implies:
- Local refinement is complete for polynomial-time computation
- EntropyDepth is a universal obstruction
- Superlinear entropy lower bounds imply P ≠ NP

A negative answer implies:
- Existence of irreducibly global polynomial-time computation
- Failure of locality as a fundamental principle of computation
- Breakdown of information-accounting limits

Either resolution forces a foundational revision of complexity theory.

### CutStrings (Canonical URF Primitive)

**Definition.**
CutStrings is a uniform process that partitions an input string into substrings using a fixed, uniform cut rule.

**URF Status.**
- If cut indices are part of the uniform input encoding (or depend only on position counters), then CutStrings is **URF-ADMISSIBLE**.
- If cut selection depends on a global predicate of the input (e.g. parity), CutStrings is **NOT URF-ADMISSIBLE** with a certified locality violation.

**Witnesses.**
- YES: locality radius O(1), per-step injected information O(log n), valid accounting.
- NO: single-step global cut selection requires radius Ω(n).

**Purpose.**
CutStrings serves as a minimal separating example between:
- locally streamable structure, and
- irreducibly global control logic.

It is used as a benchmark primitive for enforcing URF locality and capacity discipline.
