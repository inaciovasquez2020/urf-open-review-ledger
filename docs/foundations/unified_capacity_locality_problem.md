The Unified Capacity–Locality Problem
Problem Statement
Consider any oracle-free, uniform, polynomial-time computation.
Question
Is it true that every such computation admits a simulation by a process that:
Operates only on bounded-radius local state
Injects at most polylogarithmic information per step
Has total progress (entropy reduction or structural refinement) bounded by total injected information
Equivalent Formulation
Is global computational progress universally limited by local information capacity?
Significance
A positive answer implies:
Local refinement is complete for polynomial-time computation
EntropyDepth is a universal obstruction
Superlinear entropy lower bounds imply

A negative answer implies:
Existence of irreducibly global polynomial-time computation
Failure of locality as a fundamental principle of computation

CutStrings (Canonical URF Primitive)
Definition
CutStrings is a uniform process that partitions an input string into substrings according to a fixed, uniform cut rule.
The process operates sequentially and emits substrings based on a deterministic rule applied at each step.
URF Admissibility
URF-ADMISSIBLE case.
If cut indices are part of the uniform input encoding or depend only on bounded local counters (e.g. position modulo a constant), then CutStrings satisfies:
locality radius 
O

1

O(1),
per-step injected information 
O
(
log
⁡
n
)
O(logn),
valid progress accounting.
NOT URF-ADMISSIBLE case.
If cut selection depends on a global predicate of the input (e.g. parity, global checksum, or any nonlocal property), then CutStrings violates URF locality and capacity constraints.
Certified Witnesses

A single-step cut decision depending on a global predicate requires locality radius 
Ω

Ω(n), yielding a certified violation of URF condition (A) and, when formalized, condition (B).
Purpose
CutStrings is a minimal separating primitive between:
locally streamable structure, and
irreducibly global control logic.
It serves as a canonical benchmark object for:
testing URF locality and capacity constraints,
generating certified NO instances,
enforcing information-accounting discipline in the URF framework.
Relationship to URF-ADMISSIBLE
URF-ADMISSIBLE is the decision interface that determines whether a given process respects bounded locality, bounded information injection, and valid progress accounting.
CutStrings provides:
a concrete YES instance demonstrating admissibility under purely local control, and
a concrete NO instance demonstrating failure under global control.
These instances are used to anchor the abstract statements of the Unified Capacity–Locality Problem in explicit, verifiable artifacts.
Status
URF-ADMISSIBLE is defined as a total decision predicate.
The Unified Capacity–Locality Problem concerns the universal quantifier over all polynomial-time computations.
CutStrings is a frozen, canonical benchmark primitive for this program.
