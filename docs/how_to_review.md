How to Review a URF Manuscript

This repository hosts open, technical peer review for frozen manuscripts.
Manuscripts themselves live in separate repositories; this ledger records review state.

What reviewers are asked to evaluate

- Correctness of definitions
- Logical validity of lemmas and theorems
- Explicitness of assumptions
- Scope discipline (what is and is not claimed)

What counts as a blocking issue

- A concrete counterexample
- A precisely stated missing lemma or assumption
- A logical gap that invalidates a downstream result

What does not count as a blocking issue

- Disagreement with motivation or framing
- Preference for alternative models or formalisms
- Requests for empirical validation
- Objections to scope limitations explicitly stated by the author

How to submit a review

- Comment on the active Review issue for the manuscript ID
- Reference theorem, lemma, or definition numbers
- Classify feedback as one of:
  ERROR
  MISSING ASSUMPTION
  CLARIFICATION
  NON-BLOCKING SUGGESTION

Reviews are permanent

- Reviews are public
- Real names or pseudonyms are allowed
- All state transitions are recorded

Goal

The goal is not consensus or acceptance by authority.
The goal is a precise public record of what is correct, conditional, or false.
