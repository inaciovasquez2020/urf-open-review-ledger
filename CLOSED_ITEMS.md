PSH_{k,\Delta,r} CLOSED via 

<<<<<<< HEAD
PSH_{k,Δ,r} is closed only in the rank-bounded FO^k / r-round pebble sense.
Rank-bounded closure only: PSH_{k,\Delta,r}. No unbounded-round pebble game, no full FO^k, no global k-WL stabilization.
=======
PSH closure is rank-bounded only: PSH_{k,Δ,r} (r-round k-pebble / FO^k rank ≤ r).
No unbounded-round pebble game, no full FO^k, and no global k-WL stabilization is assumed.
