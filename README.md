# URF Core — Foundational Logic Layer

Canonical foundational logic repository for the Unified Rigidity Framework (URF).

This repository defines the mathematical, logical, and certificate-semantic base of the URF program.  
All downstream executable, packaging, and environment layers derive their meaning from this layer.

---

## Purpose

To provide the canonical source of:

• URF axioms and invariant definitions  
• Formal reduction theorems and obstruction statements  
• Primitive certificate semantics (meaning and validity conditions)  
• Formal proof architecture entry points (Lean, LaTeX, logical certificates)  

This repository is the semantic authority for URF correctness.

## Layer Position

URF Layer Stack

Core → Prefab → Infrastructure → Applications

Core defines truth conditions and invariant structure.  
Prefab freezes executable packaging of Core outputs.  
Infrastructure provides reproducible execution environments.  
Applications consume certified logic.

---

## Canonical Scope

### Mathematical Foundations
• Rigidity principles  
• Capacity–locality constraints  
• Admissibility and invariant structure  
• EntropyDepth and Chronos structural reductions  

### Certificate Semantics
• Logical validity rules  
• Certificate meaning definitions  
• Structural admissibility interpretation  
• Primitive schema semantics (not packaging format)

### Proof Architecture
• Lean formalization entry points  
• Reduction skeletons  
• Conditional closure boundaries (explicitly labeled)  

---

## Explicit Non Scope

This repository intentionally does NOT provide:

• CI packaging or pipeline orchestration  
• Frozen prefab bundles  
• Container or environment reproducibility layers  
• End user execution tooling  
• Deployment workflows  

These belong to Prefab or Infrastructure layers.

## Dependencies

Semantic Dependencies: None  
Mathematical Dependencies: Standard mathematical foundations only  

Downstream Consumers:

## Stability Model

Status: Canonical Foundational Layer  

Change Rules:

• Mathematical meaning changes must originate here  
• Downstream layers must not redefine certificate semantics  
• Conditional components must remain explicitly labeled  
• Versioning follows semantic mathematical compatibility  

---

## Formal Interfaces Exported

Core exports:

• Certificate semantic definitions  
• Invariant and admissibility logic  
• Formal theorem reference identifiers  
• Lean formalization modules  
• Logical validity boundary definitions

## Relationship to Prefab Layer

Prefab Layer Responsibilities:

• Freeze executable schema realizations  
• Provide deterministic verifiers  
• Provide CI reproducible bundles  
• Provide importable prefab logic modules  

Core remains the semantic authority.
